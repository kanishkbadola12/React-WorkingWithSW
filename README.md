**Web workers:**

A Web Worker is a JavaScript script that runs in the background, independent of the main thread. Web Workers were introduced in HTML5 to help web developers overcome the limitations of single-threaded JavaScript execution.
Web Workers enable concurrent processing of tasks, making web applications faster and more responsive. They work by offloading computationally intensive tasks from the main thread, allowing it to focus on the user interface and other tasks that require immediate attention.
Web Workers are useful in scenarios where tasks take a long time to execute, such as data processing, encryption/decryption, and image processing. By using Web Workers, web developers can prevent the main thread from getting blocked, resulting in a smoother user experience.

**Service Workers:**

Service Workers are another important concept in web development. Service Workers are JavaScript files that run in the background and enable offline functionality, push notifications, and caching of resources. 
Service Workers act as a proxy between the web application and the network, intercepting network requests made by the application. They allow web applications to work offline by caching the resources required for the application to function.
Service Workers can also be used to push notifications to users even when the application is not running. This feature is particularly useful for web applications that need to send real-time notifications to users.
